This repo contains all the datasheets for the EEPROMs of various sizes used to create the [SparkFun External EEPROM Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_External_EEPROM_Arduino_Library). We didn't want to put the PDFs in that repo because it would force the download and storage of all these PDFs, every time someone downloaded that library. This is a better parking spot.

The [SparkFun External EEPROM Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_External_EEPROM_Arduino_Library) is a simple-to-use I2C library for talking to any EEPROM. It uses the same template system found in the Arduino EEPROM library so you can use the same get() and put() functions.
